# Flint Documentation TODO

## Immediate Tasks

- [ ] Add screenshots showing:
  - The Flint Project Browser in VS Code
  - A sample `flint.config.json` file
  - The gateway selector in the status bar

- [ ] Test the getting started guide with a real Ignition installation

- [ ] Add the actual flint-icon.png to `static/img/`

## Future Improvements (Optional)

- [ ] Add troubleshooting for common issues as they're discovered
- [ ] Add examples of more complex configurations
- [ ] Document any new features as they're added

## Notes

The documentation is intentionally minimal and focused on:
1. How to configure `flint.config.json`
2. How to view project contents
3. How to build and publish the extension

Everything else can be added as needed based on user feedback.
