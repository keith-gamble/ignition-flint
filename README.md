# ignition-flint README

Ignition flint is a vs code extension written to help developers write code for the Ignition platform. It provides a number of features to help with this.

## Features

Currently its only feature is breaking apart the python code in `.json` files into a virtual file for editing.

To do this when selected on a line with encoded python, click the light bulb icon and select "Edit Transform". This will open a new editor with the python code in it. When you save the file it will update the original file.
